# knowledge_cafe_project


It is a basic website that I made for my primary practice. I just started my React journey, so I made it for that.

### Description :
There are lots of blogs that have a bookmark system. I mean when you click a bookmark icon, it will show you, on the left side serially, what you want to read. Then there is also a 'mark as read' option. It does two things for you: first, it counts your reading time, and second, it removes the blog that you have already read.
